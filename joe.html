<p>These are just a few of the people that I am really close to in my everyday life. 
    I have met so many people this semester espically when i was rushing for Phi Delta Theta. It astonds 
    me that I have met at least over 180 people in one semseter here. Socially this semester has been crazy with what has all gone on.
    Some of the social media platforms I use because they are the main ways to communicate are instagram and snapchat.
