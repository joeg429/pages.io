    <h1>Joe's Semester</h1>
<div id="myDiv">
<p> The last year has been quite crazy as we all know but the cherry on top has got to be.
    The fact that I am a <b>College Freshman</b> with some of the ceaziest months of my life so far.
    It is hard to explain all that has gone on all that I did, but i can say I have enjoyed all of it no matter what it was.
    With all of this I can't believe what college life was like I mean you hear about it and you see the steryotypes around it but we actually did it that was really my life.
